# Problem Statement
The Air Pressure System is a critical component of heavy duty vehicle that uses compressed air to force a piston to provide pressure to break pads, slowing the vehicle down.The benefits of using an APS instaed o f hydraulic system are the easy availability and long-term sustainability of natural air.

This is a binary classification problem , in which the affirmative class indicates that the failure was caused by a certain component of the APS, while the negative class indicates that the failure was caused by something else.
